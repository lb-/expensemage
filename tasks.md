# Tasks

## To Do

* use a forms library:
  * https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react
  * http://gcanti.github.io/tcomb-form/
  * or look through: https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react#forms
  * would be epic if the form could be built from a json schema, itself being hosted somewhere (like myjson)


## Done

* get a basic set up of https://github.com/senecajs/varo working
  * good example: https://github.com/senecajs/react-example

* get the send button calling some function

* get it saving to myjson via Fetch (actually Reqwest)
